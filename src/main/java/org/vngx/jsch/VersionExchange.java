/**
 * <p>Implementation of SSH2 Protocol Version Exchange as described in RFC 4253
 * section 4.2.</p>
 *
 * <p>When the connection has been established, both sides MUST send an
 * identification string.  This identification string MUST be
 * <pre>
 *	SSH-protoversion-softwareversion SP comments CR LF
 * </pre>
 *
 * Since the protocol being defined in this set of documents is version 2.0,
 * the 'protoversion' MUST be "2.0".  The 'comments' string is OPTIONAL.  If the
 * 'comments' string is included, a 'space' character (denoted above as SP,
 * ASCII 32) MUST separate the 'softwareversion' and 'comments' strings.  The
 * identification MUST be terminated by a single Carriage Return (CR) and a
 * single Line Feed (LF) character (ASCII 13 and 10, respectively).
 * Implementers who wish to maintain compatibility with older, undocumented
 * versions of this protocol may want to process the identification string
 * without expecting the presence of the carriage return character for reasons
 * described in Section 5 of this document.  The null character MUST NOT be
 * sent. The maximum length of the string is 255 characters, including the
 * Carriage Return and Line Feed.</p>
 *
 * <p>The part of the identification string preceding the Carriage Return and
 * Line Feed is used in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange (see Section 8).</p>
 *
 * <p>The server MAY send other lines of data before sending the version string.
 * Each line SHOULD be terminated by a Carriage Return and Line Feed.  Such
 * lines MUST NOT begin with "SSH-", and SHOULD be encoded in ISO-10646 UTF-8
 * [RFC3629] (language is not specified).  Clients MUST be able to process such
 * lines.  Such lines MAY be silently ignored, or MAY be displayed to the client
 * user.  If they are displayed, control character filtering, as discussed in
 * [SSH-ARCH], SHOULD be used.  The primary use of this feature is to allow TCP-
 * wrappers to display an error message before disconnecting.</p>
 *
 * <p>Both the 'protoversion' and 'softwareversion' strings MUST consist of
 * printable US-ASCII characters, with the exception of whitespace characters
 * and the minus sign (-).  The 'softwareversion' string is primarily used to
 * trigger compatibility extensions and to indicate the capabilities of an
 * implementation.  The 'comments' string SHOULD contain additional information
 * that might be useful in solving user problems.  As such, an example of a
 * valid identification string is
 * <pre>
 *	SSH-2.0-billsSSH_3.6.3q3<CR><LF>
 * </pre>
 *
 * This identification string does not contain the optional 'comments' string
 * and is thus terminated by a CR and LF immediately after the 'softwareversion'
 * string.</p>
 *
 * <p>Key exchange will begin immediately after sending this identifier. All
 * packets following the identification string SHALL use the binary packet
 * protocol, which is described in Section 6.</p>
 *
